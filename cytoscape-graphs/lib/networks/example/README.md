That is most likely jQuery code (more precisely, JavaScript using the jQuery
library).  The $ represents the jQuery Function, and is actually a shorthand
alias for jQuery. (Unlike in most languages, the $ symbol is not reserved, and
may be used as a variable name.) It is typically used as a selector (i.e. a
function that returns a set of elements found in the DOM).
